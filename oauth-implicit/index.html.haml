            This tutorial will walk through the steps of going through the OAuth implicit code grant.  For more information on the implicit grant see [Use an Implicit Grant](http://developer.mypurecloud.com/api/rest/authorization/use-implicit-grant.html)
        .note.note-csharp
            In a C# desktop application, we host the login window in a webbrowser control and watch for the navigation event to occur.  When that occurs we can grab the access_token out of the URL.
        .note.note-ruby
            In a Ruby, we will start a sinatra server and open a web browser for the end user to the authorization page.


    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Redirect to PureCloud to Handle Authentication'}}
        :markdown
            When the page loads, we are going to redirect the page to the authorization url and specify.

            **response_type**: _token_ since this is an implicit (token) grant.

            **client_id**: The client ID for this application.

            **redirect_uri**: The uri to redirect to after a successful login.
    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Get the Access Token Out of the Url'}}
        :markdown
            After the redirect is followed, the url wil contain a hash (#) which contains the access token as a parameter.  We will strip out the parameter and save it to the token variable.
        .note.note-ruby
            We will post the token back to the server for use in the server.
    .step{:data=>{:title=>'Make API Calls'}}
        :markdown
            Now that we have the bearer token, we can make an ajax call to PureCloud setting the value of the **Authorization** to **bearer** _token_ where _token_ is the value we got out of the hash.
